In this scenario, you will develop immutable data structures by building on top of the core immutable data structures in the Python standard library.

We'll start by looking at tuples as a way to replace arrays, and then use
named tuples to reduce boilerplate. Finally, we'll tie it all together and
build a new data structure from scratch.
