In this scenario, you learned about higher-order functions, and then applied
them to a real-world data cleaning problem. Before you go, think about places
where you see lots of duplication in your codebase, or you want to split a
task into lots of small steps.

If you want a challenge exercise, try writing a higher-order function that
produces the functions `convert_age_to_number` and `convert_salary_to_number`
that we used in Step 4.
