In this scenario, you learned what a decorator is, how to apply one, and how
to write your own. You worked from basic decorators that just add print
statements all the way up to those that work with and even modify the inputs
and outputs of a function. You learned how to write and apply decorators to
add debugging information to functions by changing only one line.
